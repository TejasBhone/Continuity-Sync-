# Continuity Sync  
### Identity & Continuity Stabilization Layer for Long LLM Conversations  
© 2025 Tejas Bhone — All Rights Reserved.

Continuity Sync is a proprietary behavioral stabilization framework designed to 
preserve conversational identity, maintain continuity across long sessions, and 
reduce identity drift in LLM interactions. It provides a controlled reinforcement 
of persona-based memory and response patterns without exposing internal structures 
or requiring advanced prompting skill.

This system allows creators and engineers to maintain a consistent 
persona/identity profile across extended multi-turn workflows.
